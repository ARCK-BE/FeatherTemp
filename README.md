# FeatherTemp
A simple project for temperature monitoring using Adadfruit's Feather family of boards

The temperature is logged to an MicroSD Card on a configurable interval.

An OLED display is used to display the current time, temperature and battery status. 
This display can be toggled ON/OFF to save battery life.

This is an overall test of a few features of the Adafruit Feathers
and of the MCP9808.

This code is based on the demos provided by Adafruit.

As they say... they spend time and resources making those products and
the linked demos... So support them by purchasing their products.
